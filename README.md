
PhyloGeoRef
---------

PhyloGeoRef is a Java library for producing rich kmls containing phylogeneric data that can be rendered in google earth web browser. In biology, phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relatedness among groups of organisms (e.g. species, populations), which is discovered through molecular sequencing data and morphological data matrices.  
 The current version of phyloGeoRef is capable of constructing kml's that have the capability to display a phylogenetic tree. A phylogenetic tree as the name suggest is a simple tree diagram which shows the relationships among various biological species based upon similarities and differences in their genetic characteristics.

### QUICKSTART
You can import the project directly as an eclipse or a netbeans project. The IDE would complain about missing jars which you can find is dist/lib. Once you've done this you are ready to go. The package nescent contains some DemoMain.java files which you can have a look to get started. The Manual is also a good resource to look into.
